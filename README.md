# Flood Events Database

## About

Growing up fascinated by the power and unpredictability of water, I became a dedicated Hydroinformatics enthusiast, delving deeply into the study of flood events and their impacts. With years of experience under my belt, I recognized a significant gap: there was no comprehensive, publicly accessible global resource for flood data. This lack of information affected not only the general public but also engineers, scientists, researchers, and decision-makers who needed reliable data to make informed choices.

Determined to bridge this gap, I embarked on a mission to create a solution. Thus, the Flood Events Database was bornâ€”a free, open-source web application designed to provide users with real-time, detailed information on flood events from around the world.

### Our Mission

The Flood Events Database aims to serve both the general public and specialists by offering an extensive repository of flood event data. We collect information from a variety of sources including field data, volunteers, news websites, social media, and public records. Our goal is to democratize access to critical data, empowering everyone from concerned citizens to seasoned professionals.

### Features and Functionality

Currently in its beta version, the Flood Events Database features an interactive global map where users can click on markers to access detailed information about each flood event. This initial version includes limited features, but it is under active development with new enhancements on the horizon.

### How You Can Help

We believe in the power of community and collaboration. Registered users can contribute by adding and editing flood event data, helping to keep our database comprehensive and up-to-date. The platform is built using Python, Django (GeoDjango), and Leaflet, and we welcome developers to contribute to our codebase. Your suggestions and feedback are invaluable as we strive to improve and expand the platform.

Join us in building a resource that can make a difference in how we understand and respond to flood events globally. Together, we can turn data into actionable insights and create a safer, more informed world.
